# Problem Statement : 
In recent years, the development model of agriculture  is changing from traditional agriculture to modern intelligent agriculture; the production of vegetables in agricultural products is also increasing. However, at present, vegetable picking, sorting and sales tasks still rely on manual completion, not only a large amount of labour force is consumed, but also the work efficiency is low, which seriously affecting the development of commercialization of vegetable products. 
An intelligent system should be built for classifying vegetables to improve work efficiency and reduce labour force.
